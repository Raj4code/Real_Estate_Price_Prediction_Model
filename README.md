# Real_Estate_Price_Prediction_Model
This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict real estate prices.
The project is aimed at providing accurate price estimates for properties based
on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more.

Features:
• Machine Learning Model: Utilizes algorithms to predict property prices based on historical data.
• Flask Web Application: A Flask-based server is integrated to serve the model, providing predictions via a user-friendly web interface.
• Interactive User Interface: The UI is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to input property details and receive price predictions.
• Data Visualization: Includes visual representations of data trends and patterns to better understand the factors influencing price predictions.

Technologies Used:
• Python: Model building and backend development
• Flask: Server-side development
• Pandas, NumPy: Data preprocessing and manipulation
• Scikit-learn: Model training and evaluation
• HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Frontend development
• Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization
